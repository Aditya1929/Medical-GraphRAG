The lack of consistency in the \nfluctuation of biomolecule levels associated with disease \ndiagnosis is a barrier to the efficiency of using exosomes \nas biomarkers. Although numerous studies have identi-\nfied various types of miRs and proteins linked to speci-\nfic conditions, it is not clear which biomolecules are the \nmost reliable indicators of disease. Analyzing all possible \nbiomolecules is a time-consuming and costly process, so \na targeted approach is necessary to identify the most ef-\nfective biomarker for each condition. It is important to \nstandardize the analysis of exosomal biomolecules and",

It is important to \nstandardize the analysis of exosomal biomolecules and \nestablish a consensus on the most effective biomarkers \nbefore exosomes can be routinely used in clinical prac-\ntice as diagnostic tools.\nFuture Directions\nDeveloping standardized, efficient methods for exo-\nsome isolation and purification will be crucial for im-\nproving the accuracy and specificity of exosome-based \nCVD diagnosis and treatment. Further research into \nexosome biogenesis, cargo sorting, and secretion mecha-\nnisms will be important for advancing our understand-\ning of exosome function in CVD. To identify specific \nexosomal biomolecules with high diagnostic and thera-\npeutic potential in CVD, large-scale multicenter clinical \ntrials will be necessary.

Although these technologies \nare currently time consuming, with further advances in \nthe field of molecular biology, exosomes may be used as \nCVD biomarkers in the near future to help improve pa-\ntient outcomes. Standardized procedures for exosomal \nbiomarker analysis and evaluation will also facilitate the \ndevelopment of exosome-based clinical assays. This will \nbe an important step toward personalized and effective \nCVD treatments (Fig. 1).\nConclusion\nWith continued investment in this research and tech-\nnology development, exosomes have the potential to \nrevolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of CVD. \nHowever, the limitations of exosome isolation and pu-\nrification as well as the challenge of identifying the most \neffective exosomal miRNAs and proteins for CVD di-",

Aerobic training is an effective approach for\nweight control and improving muscle function and mass in patients\nwith sarcopenic obesity. However, few clinical studies have assessed\nthe effects of aerobic exercise on sarcopenic obesity.\nResistance exercise is considered the most effective form of\nphysical training for older people for inducing muscle hypertrophy,\nenhancing muscle function, and promoting weight loss (77). It is\nde\ufb01ned as an exercise that induces muscle contraction in response\nto external resistance, and encompasses activities such as squats, sit-\nups, and planks.

Elevated urinary albumin excretion indicates kidney damage and systemic \nvascular disease, including myocardial capillary disease and arterial stiffness. Albuminuria is associated with an increased risk \nof coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias, and microvascular disease.
